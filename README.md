# Artificial-Intelligence

I have created a game using python applying MinMax Algorithm. <br>

This game tic-tac-toe also known as noughts and crosses is a paper and pencil game for
two players, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3 x 3 grid traditionally.
The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. It is a zero-sum of perfect information
game. This means that it is deterministic, with fully observable environments
in which two agents act alternately and the utility values at the end of the
game are always equal and opposite. The optimal move for this game can be gained by
using the minimax algorithm, where the opposition between the utility functions makes the situation adversarial, hence requiring an adversarial search
supported by a minimax algorithm with the alpha-beta pruning concept in
artificial intelligence.
